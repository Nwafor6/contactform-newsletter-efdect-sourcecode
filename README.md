#setting email for contact and newsletter subscription notification in your django #project

I got my first job in a company few days ago and i was forced to learn to interact with third party apps like AWS for static file, Contact for email delivery, confirmation during newleter subscription and others. It was a borden to me at first but I had to face my fears to finsh the companys job.

In this project, I have created a demo django application of which user the source code can be copied and some personal information replied with mine. The email service that was used is GOOGLE. To get started,  make sure you create an app password for your gmail of which you will replace with in the settings.py. I hope this repo helps you solve your challenge.
